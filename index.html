                Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values,
                morals, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include teaching, training, storytelling, discussion
                and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators, however
                learners can also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal settings and any
                experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered
                educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.

                Transforming Education In India

                Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the knowledge and skills deemed necessary
                in their society. In pre-literate societies, this was achieved orally and through imitation.
                Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and skills from one generation to the next. As cultures began to
                extend their knowledge beyond skills that could be readily learned through imitation, formal education
                developed. Schools existed in Egypt at the time of the Middle Kingdom.

                1607.
                Plato founded the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in Europe.[3] The city of
                Alexandria in Egypt, established in 330 BCE, became the successor to Athens as the intellectual cradle
                of Ancient Greece. There, the great Library of Alexandria was built in the 3rd century BCE.

                The Aztecs also had a well-developed theory about education, which has an equivalent word in Nahuatl
                called tlacahuapahualiztli. It means "the art of raising or educating a person",[6] or "the art of
                strengthening or bringing up men". This was a broad conceptualization of education, which prescribed
                that it begins at home, supported by formal schooling, and reinforced by community living. Historians
                cite that formal education was mandatory for everyone regardless of social class and gender.[8] There
                was also the word neixtlamachiliztli, which is "the act of giving wisdom to the face."[7] These concepts
                underscore a complex set of educational practices, which was oriented towards communicating to the next
                generation the experience and intellectual heritage of the past for the purpose of individual
                development and his integration into the community.
